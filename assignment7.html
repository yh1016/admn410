<h2>Question 4.45</h2>
<p>Debate whether software should be copyrightable or should be freely available for copying.
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p style="font-family:futura">Software supports hardware such as computers, but we buy a computer as an actually good, many people suppose that all the functions, softwares, are come with the hardware. The fact is, all the softwares that come with the computer is an operating system, which makes sure the computer can be turned on. As for some other functions that supported by stronger application, they are not free, only for some small and easy apps are free. I thing it makes sense because small and easy softwares can be programmed in a short time and do not require much knowledge. People create in order to make others' work convenient, so this kind of small software can be free or not depends on the maker. But for some big and complex software, which made by many people or a company and takes them a long time, this kind of softwares should be sold nut not copied for free. Programmers should get reward for their hard working. So I think software should be copyrightable.</p>
<p style="font-family: futura">The benefits of the copyrightable software is people don't need to waste a bunch of time to create the kind of same software, which means they just need to make some improvement and change the content to make a fantastic software. 

This definitely hurt the company who develop this software. The copyrightable software also means the infringement of the intellectual property. If no one respects the effort and the intellectual property of the developer, then, no one want to devote them into the area of the software. Then, this area cannot make a great advances. </p>
